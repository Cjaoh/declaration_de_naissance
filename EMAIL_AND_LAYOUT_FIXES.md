# Fixes for Email and Layout Issues

## 1. Flutter Layout Overflow Error (Fixed)

The error you encountered:
```
A RenderFlex overflowed by 52 pixels on the bottom.
```

This happened because the content in your Column was taller than the available space. The fix was to wrap the Column with a `SingleChildScrollView` so that if the content overflows, users can scroll to see all elements.

The fix has been implemented in `lib/widgets/otp_verification_dialog.dart`:
- Wrapped the Column with a `SingleChildScrollView` to allow scrolling when content overflows
- This ensures all UI elements are visible on different screen sizes

## 2. Email Not Received Issue

You're not receiving emails because the email service is not properly configured. In your `lib/config/email_config.dart` file, you have placeholder values:

```dart
static const String emailJSServiceID = 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID';
static const String emailJSTemplateID = 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID';
static const String emailJSUserID = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

### How to Fix the Email Issue:

#### Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended for beginners)
1. Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Create a service and email template
3. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and User ID
4. Update `lib/config/email_config.dart` with your real credentials:
```dart
static const String emailJSServiceID = 'your_real_service_id';
static const String emailJSTemplateID = 'your_real_template_id';
static const String emailJSUserID = 'your_real_user_id';
```

#### Option 2: SendGrid
1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com/
2. Generate an API Key
3. Update `lib/config/email_config.dart`:
```dart
static const String sendGridAPIKey = 'your_real_api_key';
```

#### Option 3: SMTP
1. Get your SMTP server details from your email provider
2. Update `lib/config/email_config.dart` with your SMTP settings:
```dart
static const String smtpServer = 'your.smtp.server';
static const int smtpPort = 587; // or your port
static const String smtpUsername = 'your_username';
static const String smtpPassword = 'your_password';
```

## Testing the Fix

After configuring your email service:
1. Restart your Flutter application
2. Try the OTP verification flow again
3. Check your email inbox (and spam folder) for the verification code

## Additional Notes

- The app currently has a fallback that simulates email sending if no service is configured
- For production use, always configure a real email service
- Keep your email service credentials secure and never commit them to version control
